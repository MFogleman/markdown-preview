#Markdown Preview

This is a [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com) project.  The goal is to create a dynamic Markdown previewer, made with React and SCSS.  This app will use the [Marked](https://www.npmjs.com/package/marked) node package for the translation.  This app was initiated using the [Create-React-App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) package.  The required user stories are:


**User Story:** I can type GitHub-flavored Markdown into a text area.

**User Story:** I can see a preview of the output of my markdown that is updated as I type.
